## üß† About

SSH Manager provides a simple and robust terminal interface for all your common SSH configuration tasks. It's designed to be a powerful alternative to manually editing your `~/.ssh/config` file, reducing errors and saving time.

It is a single, self-contained `bash` script with no external dependencies beyond standard command-line tools, making it highly portable and easy to use anywhere.

## ‚ú® Features

The project is split into two scripts with distinct features:

### `ssh-manager.sh` (Main Script)

The main script provides a TUI for all your common, day-to-day SSH tasks.

- **Server Management**:
  - Interactively select a host and connect.
  - Add new hosts from scratch or by cloning an existing one.
  - Edit host parameters (alias, hostname, user, port, key file) using a step-by-step wizard.
  - `delete` and `clone` hosts.
  - Test the connection to a single host or all hosts in parallel.
- **Key Management**:
  - Generate new `ed25519` or `rsa` key pairs.
  - `delete` and `rename` key pairs.
  - Copy public keys to a remote server using `ssh-copy-id`.
  - Re-generate a public key from a private key.
  - View public key contents.
- **Port Forwarding**:
  - Save, manage, and activate port forward configurations (`~/.ssh/port_forwards.conf`).
  - View live status of active forwards.
  - `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `clone` saved configurations.
- **Direct Config Editing**:
  - A top-level menu option provides a shortcut to open your entire `~/.ssh/config` file in your default `$EDITOR`.

### `advanced-ssh-manager.sh` (Advanced Tools)

This script provides a focused TUI for more complex or potentially destructive operations.

- **Advanced Editing**: Open a specific host's entire configuration block in your `$EDITOR`.
- **Re-order**: Interactively change the order of host blocks in your config file.
- **Backup**: Create a timestamped backup of your config file.
- **Import/Export**: Export selected host configurations to a new file or import them from a file into your main config.

## üöÄ Quick Actions

**Note:** The following actions apply to the main `ssh-manager.sh` script.

Bypass the interactive menus for quick, direct actions:

- `-c, --connect`: Go directly to host selection for connecting.
- `-a, --add`: Go directly to the 'Add a new server' menu.
- `-p, --port-forward`: Go directly to the 'Port Forwarding' menu.
- `-l, --list-hosts`: List all configured hosts and exit.
- `-f, --list-forwards`: List active port forwards and exit.
- `-t, --test [host|all]`: Test connection to a specific host, all hosts, or show the selection menu.
- `-h, --help`: Show the help message.

## üì¶ Installation

This project now consists of two scripts:

- `ssh-manager.sh`: The main script for day-to-day server, key, and port-forwarding management.
- `advanced-ssh-manager.sh`: A separate script for advanced tasks like backups, import/export, and direct file editing.

1. Download the script(s) you need.
2. Make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ssh-manager.sh
    chmod +x advanced-ssh-manager.sh
    ```

3. Run it:

    ```bash
    ./ssh-manager.sh
    # or for advanced tools:
    ./advanced-ssh-manager.sh
    ```

    For convenience, place it in a directory that is in your `PATH` (e.g., `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`) to run it from anywhere.

    ```bash
    # Example:
    sudo mv ssh-manager.sh /usr/local/bin/ssh-manager
    ssh-manager # Now you can run it like this
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

The script relies on a set of common command-line tools that are pre-installed on most Linux and macOS systems:

`ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-copy-id`, `awk`, `cat`, `grep`, `rm`, `mktemp`, `cp`, `date`
